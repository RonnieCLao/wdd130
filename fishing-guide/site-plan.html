      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When was the last time you came to Idaho, a place renown throughout the world as one of the best trout fishing in the United States, and wonder where to start fishing? Fishermen like to keep their honey holes secret and are often very territorial of their spots. I want to take out the guess work that goes into fishing in eastern Idaho. Instead of tracking up and down rivers day after day. I want to create a website that offers local knowledge and charter local fishermen as guides on the beautiful rivers that run through eastern Idaho. It will entail daily communication from fishermen in the area telling where the bite was that day and what success they had. It will be a website that offers knowledge for everyone in the area so they can have better success on the water.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Intended audience will be new fishermen in the local area. As well as those that are seeking to get into the fishing seen in the Snake River area. Target will be for those over the age of 18 years old. It will include both fly fishermen and spinning reel tackle fishermen. </p>  <!-- change this -->
