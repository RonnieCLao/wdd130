        Hi my name is Ronnie Lao. I am a CIT major. I love fishing and hunting. I also enjoy indoor hobbies like reading and card collecting. 
        I am married with a child on the way in May. I love BYUI for the willingness to help and teach clearly from all professors here. 
        They are truly dedicated to help you have a great learning experience at BYUI. I am taking this course to learn more about my major. 
        I also find everthing about the functionns of the internet and the works to be facinating. I've been a member for most of my life. 
        I was about 6 or 7 when my family started going back to church. 
        I have a strong testimony that this campus is a blessing to strengthen the young saints in the last days.
